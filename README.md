# Welcome to Market API!

This is an API written in Java and Spring Boot that allows you to interact with operations to manage a market.

*This is a project based on [platzi's Java Spring course](https://platzi.com/cursos/java-spring/ "platzi's Java Spring course")*

To develop this API we used the following modules:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- Swagger
- PostgreSQL
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

The marketplace API was built under Domain Driven Design (DDD).
